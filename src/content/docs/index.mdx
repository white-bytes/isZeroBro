      <p>
      ## Ignorance is Bliss:
      > Prople use technology without understanding it and get upset when they are confused by people that do understand it..

      ## Personal Knowledge:
      > I love to break things, and make the topic bend to my will. I think most can get that concept, but I go tend to go too far
       and obsess over the the "why" and am unable to stop until I figure the result I seek or cheat to get the goal initially set.
