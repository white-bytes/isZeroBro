## Purpose
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use. I am building this out of curiosity and
> hope to learn more network security and how to protect against other like-minded individuals. 🌈 😎.

## Getting Started

### Building from Source

To build and flash the ESP32 firmware using Visual Studio Code and CMake, see the comprehensive build guide:

**📖 [Build Guide - VSCode & CMake Setup](BUILD.md)**

The guide covers:
- ESP-IDF installation and setup
- VSCode configuration with ESP-IDF extension
- Building and flashing firmware for each component
- Troubleshooting common issues

### Project Components

This project includes several ESP32-based components located in the `componets-esp/` directory:

- **WiFi Scanner** - Network scanning and analysis
- **RFID Reader** - RC522 RFID tag reading
- **UART Communication** - BadUSB functionality with Arduino Pro Micro

For detailed information about each component, see the [Components README](componets-esp/README.md).

TODO [ZERO-2]: Update more details.
